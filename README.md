# <Challenge 2>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

For this project I created a portfolio using HTML, and CSS. This portfolio is used to easily access my previous works such as my Challenge 1 and Prework study guide projects. Through the completion of this portfolio I was able to display my capabilities using CSS, aswell as my ability to use HTML. I had difficulty displaying some CSS elemements, however other than that the page works as intended.
